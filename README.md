# BeatBoi
Just a simple tool to help edit out annoying walls and bombs in Beat Saber. No install, just visit [this page](https://blogum.github.io/beatboi/).

# How to Use
It's designed to edit one song at a time, but you can upload all the difficulties for that song at once. Hit the upload button and navigate to the song you want to fix. You need to choose the files named difficulty.json, where difficulty is usually Easy, Normal, Hard, or Expert. Then just select the options for obstacles you want to remove, and click the button at the bottom. If there was a problem with one or more of your files, it should be logged under "Results." If not, you should see a new download for each of the files selected. They will be named the same as the input files, so just drag and replace them into the corresponding custom song folder. If you want to keep the old versions, just rename them to difficulty.json.bak, or similar. Restart Beat Saber and you'll be ready to go. Note that you *can* edit as many songs as you want per batch, but since the downloaded file names have no indication of the song, they'll be hard to differentiate.
